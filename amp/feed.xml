&lt;p&gt;*Original publication can be found on Code Academy &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.codecademy.com/myspace-and-the-coding-legacy/&quot; title=&quot;https://news.codecademy.com/myspace-and-the-coding-legacy/&quot;&gt;https://news.codecademy.com/myspace-and-the-coding-legacy/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an entire generation, MySpace was a gateway to the addictive social networking platforms that are now a ubiquitous feature of our lives. And for many members of that same generation, MySpace was a gateway to another inescapable part of modern life—writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the site’s demise nearly ten years ago, certain totems of the MySpace experience have stuck in our collective memories—e.g. the top 8, auto-playing music, and, of course, Tom. But of all the features that made MySpace the cultural sensation that it was, the ability to style a profile page with HTML and CSS might have left the biggest footprint behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tens of millions of people, tinkering with anchor and style tags to personalize a MySpace profile was an introduction to code as a means to solving a problem, to expressing something about yourself, or to just experimenting and seeing what happened. The flat-out necessity of having a customized profile brought forth an entire ecosystem of theme sellers and HTML tutorial writers, early pioneers in their own right who commodified their coding knowledge while convincing millions that writing code was something they could do too. So let’s look back on what made MySpace so code-friendly, and on how that friendliness eventually played a part in the site’s downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/spongebob-myspace-layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-place-for-friends&quot;&gt;A Place for Friends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2009 New York Times review of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/books/review/Agger-t.html&quot;&gt;Stealing MySpace,&lt;/a&gt;Michael Agger described MySpace as the “product of striving, nighttime Los Angeles, where you go to be famous, to be something new.” Its allure was in allowing users—the vast majority of whom were teenagers and young adults—to invent and express a three-dimensional, digital version of themselves, from their profile photo, to the eight friends they considered closest, down to the font and background images on their profile pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the styling of your MySpace profile was a way to distinguish yourself from your friends. With a cursor depicting a favorite movie character, or font color combinations that recalled a favorite sports team’s colors, users could use every pixel on the profiles to set themselves apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySpace wasn’t the only platform that allowed this kind of expression through code—Xanga, Tumblr, Pitas, and plenty of other platforms allowed users to customize their profiles with HTML and CSS. But as the most popular of the bunch by far, with over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/technology/21myspace.htm&quot;&gt;110 million active users&lt;/a&gt; at its peak, MySpace was the standard-bearer, and the one that left the biggest legacy behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-happy-accident&quot;&gt;A Happy Accident&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code-friendly nature of MySpace was actually borne out a mistake. As Julia Angwin explains in her aforementioned 2009 book Stealing MySpace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Site in America, MySpace’s lead developer quit one month after the site launched in 2003. This left the remaining team with a site written in Perl, which nobody else at the company was familiar with. In response, the team paid developers Gabe Harriman and Toan Nguyen to rewrite the entire site in Adobe’s ColdFusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while rewriting MySpace, Harriman and Nguyen made a major mistake—they failed to block users from adding their own HTML and CSS to their profile pages. In Angwin’s telling, the team’s mistake was what “allowed users to build colorful backgrounds and wallpaper and load them onto their MySpace pages. Suddenly teenage girls could decorate their MySpace page with hearts and glitter and smiley faces the same way that they were decorating their lockers and book bags.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/gwen-stefani-myspace-layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mistake created security vulnerabilities and crippled page load speeds. According to Angwin, a panicking product manager alerted Harriman that “someone hacked our site” after first noticing a profile with altered font colors and background images. But the accidental feature set was an immediate hit with users. The company decided to hold off on patching up the mistake because “users come first, and this is what they want,” former MySpace staffer Jason Feffer told Angwin. The rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-profile-customization-worked&quot;&gt;How Profile Customization Worked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MySpace profile editor was freeform enough to allow inline style attributes, tables, embedded widgets built in Flash or JavaScript, and just about anything else that could be expressed in HTML. Taking advantage of this freedom was only possible with either a rudimentary understanding of HTML and CSS, or access to code snippets that could be blindly copied and pasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/image1-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Embedding a Flash widget with the Myspace profile editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming hunger for customization among the userbase spawned an entire sub-economy of layout sellers, tutorial pages, and ad-heavy websites that provided code snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/layout-2006-smaller.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The header of a profile customization page called “Graphics 4 myspace” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190318093525/https://web.archive.org/web/20060426230312/http://www.myspace.com:80/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;amp;friendID=2617807&amp;amp;Mytoken=20040716055953&quot;&gt;archived ca. 2006&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a legitimate income stream for many users who already had a bit of coding knowledge. For example, PatrickJS, a Y Combinator-backed founder who we previously profiled , told me his first experience as an entrepreneur was creating and selling MySpace layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these layout specialists did more than just create bespoke layouts for a fee—they sought to teach the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, empowering anyone who visited their profile to create and edit layouts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such account was known as “Mack,” or the “Profile Master.” For a time, the Profile Master’s page was linked to directly from the “About me” section on Tom Anderson’s profile. Tom was every MySpace user’s first friend by default, so his profile was among the most visited pages on the most visited website in the United States [&lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2006/07/11/myspace-americas-number-one/&quot; title=&quot;https://mashable.com/2006/07/11/myspace-americas-number-one/&quot;&gt;https://mashable.com/2006/07/11/myspace-americas-number-one/&lt;/a&gt;]. The prime real estate he granted to the Profile Master speaks to the fact that HTML and CSS were not just features—they were a foundational part of life on MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/Screen-Shot-2018-07-09-at-12.07.49-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;The “About me” section of Tom Anderson’s MySpace profile (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190318093525/https://web.archive.org/web/20050406102156/https://myspace.com/tom&quot;&gt;archived ca. 2005&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Profile Master” account featured written tutorials on concepts like “Text Effects,” “Adding Borders,” and “JavaScripts” (sic). These articles are no longer online, but the rest of the archived &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20050411082526/http://www.myspace.com:80/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendid=812799&quot;&gt;“Profile Master”&lt;/a&gt; page suggests that they were intended to empower users to code profile changes themselves, rather than wait around for the Profile Master’s help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/profile-master-description-small.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;A snippet of the Profile Master’s “About me” section (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190318093525/https://web.archive.org/web/20050411082526/http://www.myspace.com:80/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendid=812799&quot;&gt;archived ca. 2005&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of other layout pages that adopted this same approach, with names like “Myspace Layouts” and “Graphics 4 myspace.” Knowingly or not, these pages introduced a generation to some of the same web development skills that are now an invaluable asset in numerous career paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/Screen-Shot-2018-07-10-at-11.25.43-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Another snippet of the Profile Master’s “About me” section (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190318093525/https://web.archive.org/web/20050411082526/http://www.myspace.com:80/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendid=812799&quot;&gt;archived ca. 2005&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might seem like silly relics of a slightly embarrassing fad now, but these pages were valuable educational resources for a population that may not have had access to such an education otherwise. Computer Science education was not as prevalent at the high school level as it is today, and Codecademy was years away from being founded. These pages were likely the most widely-accessible coding tutorials available to the general public at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-demise-of-myspace&quot;&gt;The Demise of MySpace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of unrestrained self-expression MySpace enabled was great for users, but it wasn’t very appealing to advertisers. Brian Stelter’s 2008 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/technology/21myspace.html&quot;&gt;New York Times profile&lt;/a&gt; of MySpace and its founders, written three years after the News Corp purchased the company for $580 million, focused heavily on the “big contrast between the chaos that is comfortable to many MySpace residents and the neatness that appeals to consumer product companies.” With the acquisition came increased pressure to turn a profit, and highly-customized profiles were seen as a hindrance to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/kill-bill-myspace-layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time of the Times profile, Facebook began to emerge as a legitimate MySpace competitor. Its profile pages were (and still are) the polar opposite of MySpace—almost sterile in comparison. If MySpace was the equivalent of a high schooler’s decorated locker, Facebook was the nurse’s office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook also attracted a different demographic than MySpace, thanks in large part to its early policy of requiring a college email address to create an account. This combination of factors led to a platform that was seen as safer by advertisers, with a slightly older user base that had more money to spend. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/technology/21myspace.html&quot;&gt;Stelter&lt;/a&gt; put it at the time, “Facebook, with its cleaner interface and higher demographic profile, is also seen by some advertisers as a better bet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how the rest of the story goes. While Facebook used its reputation with advertisers to morph into the behemoth it is today, MySpace took half-hearted steps to mimic it—like doing away with code editing—before essentially vanishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been over nine years since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcworld.com/article/166794/Facebook_Overtakes_MySpace_in_US.html&quot;&gt;Facebook’s traffic surpassed MySpace’s&lt;/a&gt; and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After MySpace, no social network has been quite as code-forward. The limits of customizability on Facebook and Twitter profiles are your profile photo and cover image. On Instagram, it stops with the profile picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These social networking sites still allow for MySpace-level personal mythmaking, but without ever writing a line of code. Higher bandwidth and platform optimization around multimedia have made photos and videos the preferred form of expression. In other words, Boomerangs and Snapchat filters are the new glittering backgrounds and auto-playing Soulja Boy songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uploads/nightmare-before-christmas-myspace-layout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these platforms have opened themselves up to code editing, likely due to the same security and advertising concerns that led to MySpace’s demise. It’s fair to predict that they probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though coding and social networking are no longer kindred spirits, plenty of professional platforms have taken MySpace’s lead and leaned into code customizability. For example, email platforms like MailChimp and Customer.io, as well as blogging platforms like Wordpress and Ghost, are much more powerful tools when you’re comfortable with HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MySpace generation has grown up, left the site, and entered an economy that’s hungry for the same web development skills that MySpace users got a taste of while fiddling with their profiles. So if you’re feeling nostalgic about &lt;strong&gt;a href&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;img src=&lt;/strong&gt; being regular parts of your life, know that it’s easier than ever to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css?utm_source=ccblog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=publication&amp;amp;utm_content=MySpace&quot;&gt;brush up on those skills&lt;/a&gt; and take them further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll probably never see another social networking platform with MySpace’s combination of code-friendliness and overwhelming popularity again. That is, unless you build the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunities-after-bootcamp&quot;&gt;Opportunities After Bootcamp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Development is an all-encompassing term that focuses on the development of websites and web applications. Jobs may include web-based internet applications, social networking platforms, and electronic business platforms. Individuals trained in this field may work in web content development, web engineering, cybersecurity, or design. This training could also lead to the development of CRM systems, still considered a new branch of web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, virtually every business and individual contractor needs a website and payment platform to operate. This means more jobs for individuals like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Growth&lt;/strong&gt;: “The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm&quot;&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt; projects about 13 percent employment growth for web developers by 2026. During that period, about &lt;strong&gt;21,300 new jobs&lt;/strong&gt; will need to be filled in an industry that already &lt;strong&gt;has roughly 162,900 positions&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Developer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Web developers&lt;/strong&gt;, also called &lt;strong&gt;web&lt;/strong&gt; designers or webmasters, design and maintain websites. You might design and develop basic website layout or advanced interactive website features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Web&lt;/strong&gt; application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development. &lt;strong&gt;Web engineering&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the specifics of application development that apply to websites and their offsets.&lt;/p&gt;

But what if you want to speed things up a little? When it comes to getting a job as a developer, you may not want to wait for years to get started. Good news: there are some things you can do in your spare time every day that will help you get better in less time. Here are five things to try to learn to program faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-practice-every-day-on-real-projects&quot;&gt;1. Practice every day on real projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any other job, having hands-on experience is a must. Whether it’s for your own personal website or a project for a close friend or family member, try to find actual assignments to give yourself for practice. When you get to flex your coding muscles on things that will actually live on the internet, you put yourself into an immersive environment, giving you a better chance to become fluent quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-use-free-coding-websites-for-tutorials-and-projects&quot;&gt;2. Use free coding websites for tutorials and projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for aspiring developers, there is no shortage of resources online these days. Using platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt;CodeAcademy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeavengers.com/&quot;&gt;Code Avengers&lt;/a&gt;, you can access free tutorials and cool project prompts. On any of these sites, you’ll work on interactive platforms, learning languages such as JavaScript, PHP, and Python to create web apps, games, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-make-and-use-flashcards&quot;&gt;3. Make and use flashcards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can handle the flashbacks to high school, go old-school and use flashcards! In the same way they helped you master vocabulary words for the SAT, flashcards can help you learn common terms for whatever coding language you’re trying to master. They’re also portable, meaning you can break them out at breakfast, on the bus to work, or when you need a five-minute break from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have index cards handy, hate your handwriting, or are just too embarrassed to be seen holding flashcards in public, you can also use an app like &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flashcards+-by-chegg-free/id408490162?mt=8&quot;&gt;Flashcards+&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/studyblue/id323887414&quot;&gt;StudyBlue&lt;/a&gt; to get the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-blog-about-it&quot;&gt;4. Blog about it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to put new knowledge to the test is to try to explain it to someone else. Consider creating a personal blog to help you document your journey to becoming a masterful developer. In addition to serving as a great reminder of how far you’ve come, blogging about what you’re learning helps cement new concepts so they can connect to the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, it can also be a great way to network. By connecting with other developers, whether they’re more or less experienced than you, you have the opportunity to share what you’ve learned and take advantage of the knowledge of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a great writer? You may want to consider recording yourself and creating a vlog to share your learnings in video form instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-take-a-class-or-coding-bootcamp&quot;&gt;5. Take a class or coding bootcamp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootcamps and classes are another excellent way to learn to program faster. Classes are instructor-led, allowing students to get hands-on experience and work directly with professors. Taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://circlecoding.com/courses/web-development/&quot;&gt;Full Stack Web Development Program&lt;/a&gt; we offer at Circle Coding Academy can take you from no experience to a job-ready web developer in under a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing with your organization, changing careers, or getting serious about a hobby all starts with mastering the subject matter. If you’re a programmer or a future programmer in the Dallas area, we’d love to talk to you about how our 32-week program can help you transition into a career as a developer or sharpen your existing skills.

JS earned its popularity because it’s easy to learn, dynamically typed, fast to run, and works across most platforms, including all modern web browsers. Coders from all different specialties will need a basic understanding of JavaScript to complete most designs—especially front-end designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some impressive projects that might inspire you to want to start learning JavaScript now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;smart-technology-and-talking-plants&quot;&gt;Smart technology and talking plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart technology has the potential to improve our healthcare, revolutionize our workplaces, and customize our homes. As this trend in smart tech progresses, we may find ourselves living in a sci-fi utopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One appealing smart-tech project uses JavaScript code to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webondevices.com/the-arduino-plant-with-javascript-voice-recognition/&quot;&gt;smart plants&lt;/a&gt;. Smart plants use sensors to detect soil moisture, temperature, and other factors important for plant health. Advanced voice recognition software and text-to-voice capability makes it easy to interact with smart plants and simplifies the plant maintenance process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart technology is an emerging field that will soon change our lives. Learning JavaScript could provide you with the skill set necessary to land a job in this new and exciting industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drones-that-fly-themselves&quot;&gt;Drones that fly themselves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones aren’t just fun; they’re useful, with applications in aerial photography, package deliveries, safety inspections, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virgin.com/virgin-unite/business-innovation/humanitarian-sky-drones-disaster-response&quot;&gt;humanitarian efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using JavaScript, it’s possible to build self-driving drones. Lines of JS code can command drones to auto-hover, perform barrel rolls, and run into red objects like a matador would do with a bull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At events like &lt;a href=&quot;http://dronegames.co/&quot;&gt;Drone Games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nodecopter.com/&quot;&gt;Nodecopter&lt;/a&gt;, programmers use software to see who can make the coolest drone. They often reuse open-source code snippets to program features like voice to text, face recognition, and advanced directional 3D movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these projects are fun, they can also help you land a job. The drone job market will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/Drone-Related-Job-Growth-to-Outpace-Predictions.html&quot;&gt;grow faster than predicted&lt;/a&gt;, and some universities even offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.govtech.com/budget-finance/Drone-Related-Job-Growth-to-Outpace-Predictions.html&quot;&gt;degrees in drone technology&lt;/a&gt;. Industries that will use drones include the military, real estate, construction, filmmaking, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://uavcoach.com/uav-jobs/#guide-5&quot;&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more about what it takes to get into the drone industry by reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://jobs.ieee.org/jobs/content/Drones-are-a-big-job-opportunity-but-for-new-engin-2017-02-10&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile-apps-that-dominate-industries&quot;&gt;Mobile apps that dominate industries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brainhub.eu/blog/famous-apps-built-with-react-native/&quot;&gt;Many apps&lt;/a&gt; use the JS react native framework, but the Facebook ads app is a particularly shining example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/developer-tools/react-native-for-android-how-we-built-the-first-cross-platform-react-native-app/&quot;&gt;Facebook uses JS&lt;/a&gt; to calculate complex variables like ad formats, time zones, dates, and currencies. Many of these features are accessible through an &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.mybridge.co/amazing-javascript-projects-for-the-past-year-v-2018-2f114c6bd70a&quot;&gt;open-source JavaScript code&lt;/a&gt;. The react native framework is also perfect for creating an integrated user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tech giants like Facebook use JS, it shows that the language is not limited to small app projects. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telerik.com/blogs/5-benefits-of-reactjs-to-brighten-a-cloudy-day&quot;&gt;JavaScript has key advantages&lt;/a&gt; that make it perfect for projects of any size. Learning JS can help developers build projects at any scale—big or small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;websites-to-inspire-action&quot;&gt;Websites to inspire action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website design skills are growing in demand. Companies spend a lot of time and money trying to drive traffic to their website. Designers who can convert that traffic into paying customers are especially competitive in the job market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the perfect tool for building &lt;a href=&quot;http://webdesignerwall.com/trends/30-truly-interactive-websites-built-css-javascript&quot;&gt;stunning websites.&lt;/a&gt; The code is fast, and object manipulation makes it possible to create amazing interactive designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning JavaScript will prepare you for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://austincodingacademy.com/blog/web-development/what-will-you-make-as-a-full-time-web-developer/&quot;&gt;lucrative career&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to wait until after graduation to get started. Working on side projects is a great way to hone your skills and build up your &lt;a href=&quot;https://austincodingacademy.com/blog/web-development/what-are-companies-looking-for-in-a-web-developers-portfolio/&quot;&gt;developer’s portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some amazing websites to inspire your next web-design project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://windowwonderland.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Window Wonderland&lt;/a&gt;: This website puts you right in the middle of New York City’s holiday shopping experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cavalierchallenge.com/&quot;&gt;Cavalier Challenge&lt;/a&gt;: This online game immerses you in a experience right from the get-go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://airview.blueair.com/&quot;&gt;Air View&lt;/a&gt;: Air View is an innovative way to visualize abstract air quality data to make it feel “real.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keyideas.net/&quot;&gt;Key Ideas&lt;/a&gt;: Key Ideas is a film-production agency that uses their website to showcase their unique skills and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Use this guide to explore the field, the job opportunities associated, and offerings within Circle Coding Academy’s program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunities-after-bootcamp&quot;&gt;Opportunities After Bootcamp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web Development is an all-encompassing term that focuses on the development of websites and web applications. Jobs may include web-based internet applications, social networking platforms, and electronic business platforms. Individuals trained in this field may work in web content development, web engineering, cybersecurity, or design. This training could also lead to the development of CRM systems, still considered a new branch of web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, virtually every business and individual contractor needs a website and payment platform to operate. This means more jobs for individuals like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Growth&lt;/strong&gt;: “The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm&quot;&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt; projects about 13 percent employment growth for web developers by 2026. During that period, about &lt;strong&gt;21,300 new jobs&lt;/strong&gt; will need to be filled in an industry that already &lt;strong&gt;has roughly 162,900 positions&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Developer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Web developers&lt;/strong&gt;, also called &lt;strong&gt;web&lt;/strong&gt; designers or webmasters, design and maintain websites. You might design and develop basic website layout or advanced interactive website features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Web&lt;/strong&gt; application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development. &lt;strong&gt;Web engineering&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the specifics of application development that apply to websites and their offsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-web-development-can-boost-your-career&quot;&gt;Learning Web Development Can Boost Your Career&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Development has one of the highest job opening rates in the world.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mjd45eilkk/web-development/#7864f8833180&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forbes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published an article celebrating Web Development as one of the top freelance careers, with freelancers earning an average of $36 to $40 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/04/10/five-reasons-why-web-development-is-a-better-career-path-than-machine-learning/#378689f53ddf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some articles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have even claimed that learning Web Development is more valuable than learning Machine Learning for a few reasons: There are countless jobs, it is a simple and straightforward working process, it is creative and fun, and is also extremely lucrative. This linear career path makes room for learning new working systems and trends, while also leaving space for creative liberty and thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;circle-coding-academy-web-development-program&quot;&gt;Circle Coding Academy Web Development Program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circle Coding Academy’s Full Stack Web Development Program is designed to take students from no experience to job-ready web developers in just 36 weeks of part-time, evening classes.&lt;/p&gt;

He is a User Experience Developer at Indeed! He shared some insider tips and tricks for prospective and current students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where are you from?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Austin, born and raised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is your current job title?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am a User Experience Developer at Indeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What were you doing before you signed up for ACA?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I worked in Graphic Design. That is actually what sparked my interest in coding. I sat near web developers and became curious about what they did.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did you hear about ACA?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What inspired you to take the leap from graphic design to web development?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to be involved in every process of a project. I was already proficient in HTML and CSS, so I wanted to take it a step further and dive into JavaScript.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the best thing about coding?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code is a big puzzle to solve and I love problem solving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the best perk?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I am finally getting paid my worth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What advice do you have to prospective and/or current ACA students?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t give up! I didn’t get a job immediately after graduation, so I spent that time sharpening my skills and networking. Make friends in the field - networking is so important!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Austin Coding Academy and Lubbock Coding Academy will continue to operate normally in their respective cities, with classes continuing to be held at both Austin Coding Academy - Highland and Austin Coding Academy - Capital Factory in Austin and at the South Plains College Lubbock Center in Lubbock.

It seems like after kindergarten graduation, school and life stopped asking what you wanted to be and instead started telling you what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like most millennials, you probably aren’t happy with your current job and don’t see much potential for upward mobility or meaningful contribution… you are not alone. Millennials feel stuck - longing to create and contribute in meaningful ways but lacking the technical skills and experience to land high-paying, in-demand jobs. The disparity is even greater in non-urban areas like Lubbock, where education funding and offerings tend to lag behind larger cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequences of lower quality education lead to less developed workforce skillsets and force local employers to recruit “out of town” talent to fill the higher-paying, more skilled technology jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developer roles offer compensation, lifestyle and meaningful contribution opportunities that are often ideal for millennials and contain the ingredients for long, happy and fulfilling careers. &lt;strong&gt;The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median salary for web developers was $110,000 (May 2018) and the employment of software developers is projected to grow 24% between 2016 - 2026.&lt;/strong&gt; Attuned to employer demand, the rise of coding academies has begun to bridge the ‘skills gap’ in preparing people for careers in tech. However, these coding schools have been exclusive to densely populated metroplexes allotting little regard for equally talented, less industrious areas that have served as the backbone of America’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of innovative education opportunities and computer programming skill sets continue to place rural workers and employers in a bind. Workers are willing to learn new skills to qualify for jobs in technology, but local employers can’t front the cost of building and teaching a curriculum that delivers the necessary skills for success in these roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensing rising frustrations and witnessing a constant &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/what-is-brain-drain/&quot;&gt;“Brain Drain”&lt;/a&gt; of local Lubbock talent to urban cities, Texas Tech commissioned Austin Coding Academy to equip Lubbock area workers with the coding skills to win rewarding careers in technology here at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lubbock Coding Academy (now a partner with the Lubbock Economic Development Association (LEDA), South Plains College and Texas Tech University) provides ‘full-stack’ coding education and skill development through part-time, in-person classes allowing students to keep their day jobs while gaining the skills to upgrade careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 32-week program meets twice a week in the evenings and consists of four 8 week classes taught by full-time developers who know exactly what it takes to succeed in a career in tech. Students have access to unlimited one-on-one tutoring sessions, Saturday study groups and initiate countless meetups at local libraries and coffee shops to understand the nuances of their new highly valuable skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lubbock Coding Academy’s coding curriculum is completely customized to the request of 12 of Lubbock County’s largest employers (including Tyler Technologies, SitePro, Texas Tech &amp;amp; many others) who as a group have stated &lt;strong&gt;they plan to hire 50 - 100 developers in each of the next five years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lubbock Coding Academy (LCA) graduates are finding themselves in the perfect position to secure these careers thanks to their ‘full-stack’ education and access to LCA’s &lt;strong&gt;Job Placement Program&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition to the 32-week curriculum, LCA offers students a free four-week job placement course where they work on best practices for resume building, participate in mock interviews and whiteboarding sessions, and attend networking events with local employers and LCA partners. Additionally, LCA’s placement and partnerships department takes initiative to connect recent graduates with jobs in technology and boasts a &lt;strong&gt;91% placement rating&lt;/strong&gt; graduating alumni to tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February of 2019, the first group of 20 Lubbock County residents began their journey to a better life. After completing all four instructional modules and the Job Placement module at the Texas Tech Innovation Hub, &lt;strong&gt;every Lubbock Coding Academy program graduate has been successfully placed in a new career in technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Since the first cohort launch in February 2019, four more cohorts have launched in Lubbock’s Full Stack Web Development Program and are on their way to new careers in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LCA has seemed to strike a chord in Lubbock County. People of all types are excited about becoming students again and improving their skills and career possibilities. Local officials and employers are also backing the LCA partnership as a means to enhance a workforce that has previously been underestimated by outside investors. In time, Lubbock may prove to be fertile ground for new business and start-up investment, and now with a growing population of software developers and computer programmers, they won’t have to go far to find good help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Lubbock County resident who is looking to break away from the pack and chart your own path, you may be a good candidate for a career in technology through Lubbock Coding Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
